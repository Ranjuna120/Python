class EqualLoudnessFilter:
    """
    An equal-loudness filter which compensates for the human ear's non-linear response
    to sound.

    This filter corrects the frequency response by cascading a Yule-Walker approximation
    filter and a Butterworth high-pass filter.

    The filter is designed for use with sample rates of 44.1kHz and above. If you're
    using a lower sample rate, use with caution.

    The equal-loudness contours are based on the Robinson-Dadson curves (1956), which
    describe how the human ear perceives different frequencies at various loudness levels.
